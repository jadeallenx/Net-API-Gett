=head1 NAME

Net::API::Gett::File - Gett file object

=cut

use Moo;
use Sub::Quote;
use Carp qw(croak);

use MooX::Types::MooseLike qw(Int Str);

our $VERSION = '1.03';

=head1 PURPOSE

Encapsulate Gett files.  You normally shouldn't instantiate this class on 
its own, as the library will create and return this object as appropriate.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

These are read only attributes. 

=over 

=item filename

Scalar string

=item fileid

Scalar string

=item downloads

Scalar integer. The number of times this particular file has been downloaded

=item readystate

Scalar string. Signifies the state a particular file is in. See the 
L<Gett developer docs|http://ge.tt/developers> for more information.

=item getturl

Scalar string. The URL to use in a browser to access a file.

=item download

Scalar string. The URL to use to get the file contents.

=item size

Scalar integer. The size in bytes of this file.

=item created

Scalar integer. The Unix epoch time when this file was created in Gett. This value is suitable
for use in C<localtime()>.

=item sharename

Scalar string.  The share in which this file lives inside.

=item put_upload_url

Scalar string.  The url to use to upload the contents of this file using the PUT method. (This
attribute is only populated during certain times.)

=item post_upload_url

Scalar string. This url to use to upload the contents of this file using the POST method. (This
attribute is only populated during certain times.)

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item send_file()

This method actually uploads the file to the Gett service. This method is normally invoked by the
C<upload_file()> method, but it might be useful in combination with C<get_upload_url()>. It takes 
the following parameters:

=over

=item * a Gett put upload url

=item * data

a scalar representing the file contents which can be one of: a buffer, an L<IO::Handle> object, a FILEGLOB, or a 
file pathname.

=item * encoding

an encoding scheme. By default, it uses C<:raw>.

=back

Returns a true value on success.

=back

=cut

sub send_file {
    my $self = shift;
    my $url = shift;
    my $contents = shift;
    my $encoding = shift || ":raw";

    my $data;
    if ( ! ref($contents) ) {
        # $contents is scalar
        if ( ! -e $contents ) {
            # $contents doesn't point to a valid filename, 
            # assume it's a buffer

            # Make sure this data is stringified.
            $data = $contents . "";
        }
    }

    unless ( $data ) {
        $data = read_file($contents, { binmode => $encoding });
    }
    return 0 unless $data;

    my $response = $self->request->put($url, $data);

    if ( $response ) {
        return 1;
    }
    else {
        return undef;
    }
}

=over

=item get_upload_url()

This method returns a scalar PUT upload URL for the specified sharename/fileid parameters. 
Potentially useful in combination with C<send_file()>.

=back

=cut

sub get_upload_url {
    my $self = shift;
    croak "Cannot get_upload_url() without a Net::API::Gett::User object." unless $self->has_user;

    my $endpoint = "/files/$sharename/$fileid/upload?accesstoken=".$self->user->access_token;

    my $response = $self->request->get($endpoint);

    if ( $response && exists $response->{'puturl'} ) {
        return $response->{'puturl'};
    }
    else {
        croak "Could not get a PUT url from $endpoint";
    }
}

=over

=item destroy()

This method destroys the file represented by the object. Returns a true value on success.

=back

=cut

sub destroy {
    my $self = shift;
    croak "Cannot destroy() without a Net::API::Gett::User object." unless $self->has_user;

    my $sharename = $self->sharename;

    my $endpoint = "/files/$sharename/$fileid/destroy?accesstoken=".$self->access_token;

    my $response = $self->request->post($endpoint);

    if ( $response ) {
        return 1;
    }
    else {
        return undef;
    }
}
        
sub _file_contents {
    my $self = shift;
    my $endpoint = $self->request->base_url . shift;

        return $response->content();
    }
    else {
        croak "$endpoint said " . $response->status_line;
    }
}

=over

=item contents()

This method retrieves the contents of a this file in the Gett service.  You are responsible for 
outputting the file (if desired) with any appropriate encoding. Does not require an access token.

=back

=cut

sub contents {
    my $self = shift;
    my $sharename = $self->sharename;
    my $fileid = $self->fileid;

    return $self->_file_contents("/files/$sharename/$fileid/blob");
}

=over

=item thumbnail()

This method returns a thumbnail if the file in Gett is an image. Does not require an access token, but
is really only meaningful if the data is a valid image format file.

=back

=cut

sub thumbnail {
    my $self = shift;
    my $sharename = $self->sharename;
    my $fileid = $self->fileid;

    return $self->_file_contents("/files/$sharename/$fileid/blob/thumb");
}
